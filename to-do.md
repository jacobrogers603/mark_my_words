## To do

## profile

Add Settings for the profile of the user:

- profile avatar change
- change password
- delete account

hover card:

- profile bio
- https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/hover-card use for profile

## search

ability to search for notes, words in notes, and other users, search results page to do, no drop down, i don't wanna 

## photo encryption

## restrict anyone from accessing photos on nanode server with the link

check if they are logged in and have access to view the note

## make image links & templates enter the note text where the cursor was last

## Add currentPathTitles to User model in schema

we have to query the database for the name of every path title, so each layer we go down in terms of nesting for making folders and sub folders we have the ask the server what the ID's name is to display it to the user... this is bad

## deleting a note causes an error in the console despite doing the action correctly

## times on image cards say time of last render, not time of upload

## Make a public landing page 

## sign out should redirect to auth page

## If you type mark-my-words.net/<directoryName> you go there despite authentication

It will assume it is a public directory and that it is the root note and take you there
