# Mark My Words

This website provides an online profile for storing notes. They are meant to be written in markdown format. Once they are saved they can be viewed in rendered markdown, which is easy on the eye. The website is made like a file explorer, where you can make new files and folders, and sub folders and so on.

## Current Major Features

### Templates

A template is a skeleton for your notes you can make. This would be useful if there is a format you use often when making a note and you don't want to retype it every time. In user settings there is a templates area. There you can define new templates and when you are editing a note you can select from the drop down menu to apply the template to your note.

### Down and Uploading

All the notes on this site are able to be downloaded in either markdown or HTML format at any time. Notes written in markdown can also be uploaded. You can either download one file or entire directories as a zip file.

### Sharing Notes & Controlling Access

You can go to the settings page for a note and decide which other accounts can view, or edit, the note. A share link is available to be generated.

### Public Directory

A directory each user has where anything they put there will be publicly visible to all people with the link to their profile. A username is generated for them and a share link as well on their profile page page.

## In Development Features

### Encryption

All notes and templates will be made encrypted so no one but the you and whomever you assign access to can see or edit a note. Currently passwords are already hashed, and thus secure.

### Images and Videos

The ability to embed images and videos in your notes will soon be added with the normal format in markdown for doing that.

## Search
